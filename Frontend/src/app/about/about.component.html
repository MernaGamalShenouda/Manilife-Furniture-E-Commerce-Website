        <p class="about-text">
          ManiLife started as a dream in a small garage, where two friends, John
          and Sarah, shared a passion for craftsmanship and design. They
          envisioned creating furniture that not only looked beautiful but also
          lasted a lifetime.

        <p class="about-text">
          As their ideas evolved, John and Sarah spent countless hours refining
          their designs, experimenting with materials, and perfecting their
          craftsmanship. Their dedication and attention to detail laid the
          foundation for what would become ManiLife.

          Nature serves as a constant source of inspiration for ManiLife's
          designs. From the graceful lines of a tree to the subtle hues of a
          sunset, the beauty of the natural world is reflected in every piece of
          furniture created by ManiLife.
